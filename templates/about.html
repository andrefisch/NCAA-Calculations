    <font size="4"><p>In the annals of human history, a few great inventions have revolutionized fencing. &nbsp;The first of these, the mask, sharply reduced the rate of decapitations in matches. &nbsp;The second of these, electricity, allowed for fencing matches to be held at night. &nbsp;The most important of these,&nbsp;this website, allows you to understand what's happening in the NCAA Fencing Championships without actually having to do any math. &nbsp;Truly, we live in an age of wonder. You're welcome.</p>
