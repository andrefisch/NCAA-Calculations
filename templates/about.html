    <h2>About</h2>
  <font size="4"><p>In the annals of human history, a few great inventions have revolutionized fencing. &nbsp;The first of these, the mask, sharply reduced the rate of decapitations in matches. &nbsp;The second of these, electricity, allowed for fencing matches to be held at night. &nbsp;The most important of these,&nbsp;this website, allows you to understand what's happening in the NCAA Fencing Championships without actually having to do any math. &nbsp;Truly, we live in an age of wonder. You're welcome.</p>

  <h2>Competition Format:</h2>
  <p>The format of the NCAA Fencing &nbsp;Championships is as follows: for each weapon-gender (men's and women's sabre, épée, and foil), there are 24 competitors. &nbsp;Some schools have entered as many as 12 competitors across the various events, while others have just one. &nbsp;No event can have more than two competitors from any one school.</p>
  <p> Every competitor fences 23 five touch bouts over the course of their two day event (i.e. each competitor fences every other competitor). &nbsp;The three men's events are fenced on Thursday March 24th, and Friday March 25th, while the women's events are fenced on Saturday and Sunday. &nbsp;A more detailed schedule is given below. </p>
  <p>The six individual championships are determined by a four person bracket made up of the top four individual finishers in each event. &nbsp; Fifteen touch bouts then determine the winner of the individual championship.</p>
  <p> The team championship is determined by aggregating the number of wins in the regular competition (i.e. the fifteen-touch individual championship bouts have no weight on the outcom of the team championships). &nbsp;The team with the most wins is crowned team champion. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Website Format Format:</h2>
  <p>This website helps followers of the NCAA Fencing Championships observe how close a team is to winning this championship. &nbsp; For all schools, the school's place in the competition, &nbsp;and the amount of bouts it has won (with the school's win percentage in parentheses).</p>
  <p>The school in the top row is the school in first place. &nbsp;For this school, the number of bouts a school needs to "clinch" the championship is displayed (with the win percentage needed to "clinch" in parentheses). &nbsp;A school has "clinched" (i.e. won the NCAA Championship), when no school, even with a 100% win percentage, could surpass said school's toal bouts. &nbsp;When the first place school has clinched, a special message will indicate this.</p>
  <p>For all other schools, the number of bouts they need to win to catch the leading school is displayed (with the win percentage needed to take the lead in parentheses). </p>
