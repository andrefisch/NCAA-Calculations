who is very mysterious
who is a yuge spaz
who likes Columbia the perfect amount
who likes flags too much
who is an easy target
who can always accurately judge a book by its cover
who always counts his chickens accurately before they hatch
who can safely put all his eggs in one basket
who is from the same planet as Andrew Fischl
who never misses the boat because the boat always waits for him
whose guess is much better than yours
