who is so mysterious the illuminati does research about him
who can always accurately judge a book by its cover
who always counts his chickens accurately before they hatch
who can safely put all his eggs in one basket
who is from the same planet as Andrew Fischl
who never misses the boat because the boat won't leave without him
who drives the bandwagon everyone is always jumping on
whose favorite parry is duck-parry two
