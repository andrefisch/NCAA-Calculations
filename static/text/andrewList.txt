@CyrusofChaos
who sent that letter with no return address
who owns a snake
who has been to 58/59 national parks
who once used a spork as a knife
who drives the bandwagon every is always jumping on
who once killed two stones with one bird
who is from the same planet as Elijah Granet
who can add madness to any method
who plays with two full decks of cards
